Summarize phishing traits found in the email.
1. Suspicious Sender Address
The sender’s email is WellsOnlineBank2@comcast.net, not a legitimate Wells Fargo domain. Reputable institutions use official domains (e.g., @wellsfargo.com).

2. Generic Salutation
The email is sent "To: Undisclosed-Recipients", which suggests it's a mass email rather than personalized communication.

3. Urgent and Alarming Language
Phrases like “your account has been locked” and the subject “! Alerts!” are intended to create panic and pressure the recipient into acting quickly without thinking.

4. Suspicious Link
The email includes a call to action urging the user to click a link. While the link appears legitimate, phishing emails often mask malicious URLs behind trusted-looking text. (The actual link destination could be dangerous.)

5. Grammar and Formatting Errors
The phrase “We are sorry, For your protection...” has awkward punctuation and capitalization, which is uncommon in professional communication from major banks.

6. Impersonation of a Trusted Brand
The email uses Wells Fargo branding and names to appear credible, but these can be easily copied in phishing emails.
